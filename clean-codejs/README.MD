## Introduction

![Humorous image of software quality estimation as a count of how many expletives
you shout when reading code](https://www.osnews.com/images/comics/wtfm.jpg)

Software engineering principles, from Robert C. Martin's book
[_Clean Code_](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882),
adapted for JavaScript. This is not a style guide. It's a guide to producing
[readable, reusable, and refactorable](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/3rs-of-software-architecture) software in JavaScript.

Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be
universally agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are
ones codified over many years of collective experience by the authors of
_Clean Code_.

Our craft of software engineering is just a bit over 50 years old, and we are
still learning a lot. When software architecture is as old as architecture
itself, maybe then we will have harder rules to follow. For now, let these
guidelines serve as a touchstone by which to assess the quality of the
JavaScript code that you and your team produce.

One more thing: knowing these won't immediately make you a better software
developer, and working with them for many years doesn't mean you won't make
mistakes. Every piece of code starts as a first draft, like wet clay getting
shaped into its final form. Finally, we chisel away the imperfections when
we review it with our peers. Don't beat yourself up for first drafts that need
improvement. Beat up the code instead!

## **Variables**

### Use meaningful and pronounceable variable names

**Bad:**

```javascript
const yyyymmdstr = moment().format("YYYY/MM/DD");
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const currentDate = moment().format("YYYY/MM/DD");
```

### Use the same vocabulary for the same type of variable

**Bad:**

```javascript
getUserInfo();
getClientData();
getCustomerRecord();
```

**Good:**

```javascript
getUser();
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use searchable names

We will read more code than we will ever write. It's important that the code we
do write is readable and searchable. By _not_ naming variables that end up
being meaningful for understanding our program, we hurt our readers.
Make your names searchable. Tools like
[buddy.js](https://github.com/danielstjules/buddy.js) and
[ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/660e0918933e6e7fede26bc675a0763a6b357c94/docs/rules/no-magic-numbers.md)
can help identify unnamed constants.

**Bad:**

```javascript
// What the heck is 86400000 for?
setTimeout(blastOff, 86400000);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
// Declare them as capitalized named constants.
const MILLISECONDS_IN_A_DAY = 86_400_000;

setTimeout(blastOff, MILLISECONDS_IN_A_DAY);
```

### Use explanatory variables

**Bad:**

```javascript
const address = "One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014";
const cityZipCodeRegex = /^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$/;
saveCityZipCode(
  address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[1],
  address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[2]
);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const address = "One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014";
const cityZipCodeRegex = /^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$/;
const [_, city, zipCode] = address.match(cityZipCodeRegex) || [];
saveCityZipCode(city, zipCode);
```

### Avoid Mental Mapping

Explicit is better than implicit.

**Bad:**

```javascript
const locations = ["Austin", "New York", "San Francisco"];
locations.forEach(l => {
  doStuff();
  doSomeOtherStuff();
  // ...
  // ...
  // ...
  // Wait, what is `l` for again?
  dispatch(l);
});
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const locations = ["Austin", "New York", "San Francisco"];
locations.forEach(location => {
  doStuff();
  doSomeOtherStuff();
  // ...
  // ...
  // ...
  dispatch(location);
});
```

### Don't add unneeded context

If your class/object name tells you something, don't repeat that in your
variable name.

**Bad:**

```javascript
const Car = {
  carMake: "Honda",
  carModel: "Accord",
  carColor: "Blue"
};

function paintCar(car) {
  car.carColor = "Red";
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const Car = {
  make: "Honda",
  model: "Accord",
  color: "Blue"
};

function paintCar(car) {
  car.color = "Red";
}
```

### Use default arguments instead of short circuiting or conditionals

Default arguments are often cleaner than short circuiting. Be aware that if you
use them, your function will only provide default values for `undefined`
arguments. Other "falsy" values such as `''`, `""`, `false`, `null`, `0`, and
`NaN`, will not be replaced by a default value.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function createMicrobrewery(name) {
  const breweryName = name || "Hipster Brew Co.";
  // ...
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function createMicrobrewery(name = "Hipster Brew Co.") {
  // ...
}
```

## **Functions**

### Function arguments (2 or fewer ideally)

Limiting the amount of function parameters is incredibly important because it
makes testing your function easier. Having more than three leads to a
combinatorial explosion where you have to test tons of different cases with
each separate argument.

One or two arguments is the ideal case, and three should be avoided if possible.
Anything more than that should be consolidated. Usually, if you have
more than two arguments then your function is trying to do too much. In cases
where it's not, most of the time a higher-level object will suffice as an
argument.

Since JavaScript allows you to make objects on the fly, without a lot of class
boilerplate, you can use an object if you are finding yourself needing a
lot of arguments.

To make it obvious what properties the function expects, you can use the ES2015/ES6
destructuring syntax. This has a few advantages:

1. When someone looks at the function signature, it's immediately clear what
   properties are being used.
2. It can be used to simulate named parameters.
3. Destructuring also clones the specified primitive values of the argument
   object passed into the function. This can help prevent side effects. Note:
   objects and arrays that are destructured from the argument object are NOT
   cloned.
4. Linters can warn you about unused properties, which would be impossible
   without destructuring.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function createMenu(title, body, buttonText, cancellable) {
  // ...
}

createMenu("Foo", "Bar", "Baz", true);

```

**Good:**

```javascript
function createMenu({ title, body, buttonText, cancellable }) {
  // ...
}

createMenu({
  title: "Foo",
  body: "Bar",
  buttonText: "Baz",
  cancellable: true
});
```

### Functions should do one thing

This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions
do more than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about.
When you can isolate a function to just one action, it can be refactored
easily and your code will read much cleaner. If you take nothing else away from
this guide other than this, you'll be ahead of many developers.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function emailClients(clients) {
  clients.forEach(client => {
    const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
    if (clientRecord.isActive()) {
      email(client);
    }
  });
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function emailActiveClients(clients) {
  clients.filter(isActiveClient).forEach(email);
}

function isActiveClient(client) {
  const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
  return clientRecord.isActive();
}
```

### Function names should say what they do

**Bad:**

```javascript
function addToDate(date, month) {
  // ...
}

const date = new Date();

// It's hard to tell from the function name what is added
addToDate(date, 1);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function addMonthToDate(month, date) {
  // ...
}

const date = new Date();
addMonthToDate(1, date);
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Functions should only be one level of abstraction

When you have more than one level of abstraction your function is usually
doing too much. Splitting up functions leads to reusability and easier
testing.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function parseBetterJSAlternative(code) {
  const REGEXES = [
    // ...
  ];

  const statements = code.split(" ");
  const tokens = [];
  REGEXES.forEach(REGEX => {
    statements.forEach(statement => {
      // ...
    });
  });

  const ast = [];
  tokens.forEach(token => {
    // lex...
  });

  ast.forEach(node => {
    // parse...
  });
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function parseBetterJSAlternative(code) {
  const tokens = tokenize(code);
  const syntaxTree = parse(tokens);
  syntaxTree.forEach(node => {
    // parse...
  });
}

function tokenize(code) {
  const REGEXES = [
    // ...
  ];

  const statements = code.split(" ");
  const tokens = [];
  REGEXES.forEach(REGEX => {
    statements.forEach(statement => {
      tokens.push(/* ... */);
    });
  });

  return tokens;
}

function parse(tokens) {
  const syntaxTree = [];
  tokens.forEach(token => {
    syntaxTree.push(/* ... */);
  });

  return syntaxTree;
}
```

### Remove duplicate code

Do your absolute best to avoid duplicate code. Duplicate code is bad because it
means that there's more than one place to alter something if you need to change
some logic.

Imagine if you run a restaurant and you keep track of your inventory: all your
tomatoes, onions, garlic, spices, etc. If you have multiple lists that
you keep this on, then all have to be updated when you serve a dish with
tomatoes in them. If you only have one list, there's only one place to update!

Oftentimes you have duplicate code because you have two or more slightly
different things, that share a lot in common, but their differences force you
to have two or more separate functions that do much of the same things. Removing
duplicate code means creating an abstraction that can handle this set of
different things with just one function/module/class.

Getting the abstraction right is critical, that's why you should follow the
SOLID principles laid out in the _Classes_ section. Bad abstractions can be
worse than duplicate code, so be careful! Having said this, if you can make
a good abstraction, do it! Don't repeat yourself, otherwise you'll find yourself
updating multiple places anytime you want to change one thing.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function showDeveloperList(developers) {
  developers.forEach(developer => {
    const expectedSalary = developer.calculateExpectedSalary();
    const experience = developer.getExperience();
    const githubLink = developer.getGithubLink();
    const data = {
      expectedSalary,
      experience,
      githubLink
    };

    render(data);
  });
}

function showManagerList(managers) {
  managers.forEach(manager => {
    const expectedSalary = manager.calculateExpectedSalary();
    const experience = manager.getExperience();
    const portfolio = manager.getMBAProjects();
    const data = {
      expectedSalary,
      experience,
      portfolio
    };

    render(data);
  });
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function showEmployeeList(employees) {
  employees.forEach(employee => {
    const expectedSalary = employee.calculateExpectedSalary();
    const experience = employee.getExperience();

    const data = {
      expectedSalary,
      experience
    };

    switch (employee.type) {
      case "manager":
        data.portfolio = employee.getMBAProjects();
        break;
      case "developer":
        data.githubLink = employee.getGithubLink();
        break;
    }

    render(data);
  });
}
```
