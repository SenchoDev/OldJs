                    It’s natural to feel fear, confusion and overwhelm.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Humans resist change. It’s our nature. We rather be couch potatoes than have error thrown in our
                    faces by some damn programming language. <br>

                    The fear, confusion and overwhelm you feel daily are part of this resistance. No matter how much
                    you want to learn JavaScript, there’s always going to be a little bastard that tries to thwart your
                    plans from within.<br>

                    It insults you by claiming you’re stupid, and you’ll never manage to learn JavaScript.

                    It confuses and overwhelms you by throwing all sorts of random information you don’t need while
                    you’re trying your best to learn.<br>

                    It shuts you down by telling you that you should chill and watch Game of Thrones this evening, not
                    hammer away at your computer over a piece of junk.

                    Well, that’s the enemy. Within. It’s so good at concocting nonsense to make you stop learning,
                    you’ll be surprised by its creativity! Sometimes, you don’t even know why, but you just don’t feel
                    like learning! It’s incredible! <br>

                    But if you give in to the temptation, the fear, the overwhelm, the confusion, or whatever it throws
                    your way, you’re training yourself to give up.

                    Eventually, you feel you’re getting nowhere. You beat yourself up. And you’ll give up.

                    It’s okay if you’ve given up before<br>

                    IT’S OKAY!<br>

                    I’ve given up before too. Many times, in fact. So many that I’ve lost count.<br>

                    But what’s past is past. You can make a choice right now. You can choose to start anew. Things will
                    be different this time.<br>

                    You know the enemy, you know who to fight. (There’s no avoiding fear, confusion and overwhelm).<br>

                    You’ll know how to fight them too.<br>

                <h1>Fighting fear, overwhelm and confusion</h1>
                <p>
                    To stop fear, overwhelm and confusion from taking over you, you first need to know why they
                    surface. You’d know roughly why if you’ve done your homework two days ago.

                    If not, here are common reasons why people feel afraid, overwhelmed or confused when learning
                    JavaScript. You may have experienced some of these yourself:

                    You’re paralyzed. You don’t know where is the best place to start and how the entire JavaScript
                    ecosystem fits together.<br>
                    You want to find a good dev job, but the requirements are insane. There’s no way you can learn them
                    all to be a junior developer.<br>
                    You already learned the syntax, but you have no idea how to think through problems because nobody
                    taught you how to.<br>
                    You feel stupid and incapable because you cannot seem to remember anything you learn about
                    JavaScript.<br>
                    You want to make sure you’re learning the best practices so you get it right the first time. You
                    don’t want to waste time writing bad code.<br>
                    You don’t want to waste time learning and relearning frameworks. You want to pick the best possible
                    one and stick with it.<br>
                    You don’t have enough time/energy to learn JavaScript after work, studies, family and other
                    priorities. You feel completely drained.<br>
                    You struggle to understand JavaScript because you can’t find good materials to help you understand
                    WTF is actually going on.<br>
                    Supporting multiple browsers and environment scares you… there’s so many factors to watch out for
                </p>

                    <h3>The victim trap</h3>
                    <p>You’re in the victim trap if you feel that you’re powerless about your circumstances. Something
                        out there is preventing you from learning JavaScript.

                        You may resonate with these statements:<br>

                        You can’t find any good materials<br>
                        You don’t know where to start.<br>
                        You feel that its impossible to get hired because the requirements are insane.<br>
                        You can’t build things because nobody taught you how to think through problems.<br>
                        You don’t have the time/energy to learn after [insert work, family, hobbies].<br>
                        You find yourself complaining and sulking a lot. You’ll say things like:<br>

                        It’s their fault (whoever it may be) for making JavaScript so complicated. There are so many
                        tools out there, so many practices to learn and so many browsers to support.<br>

                        It’s their fault for not writing good documentation, for not writing courses and tutorials in a
                        way you understand, for not assuming you know things when you don’t.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="trap2">
                    <h3>The learn fast trap</h3>
                    <p>
                        You’re in the learn fast trap if you feel the urge to learn quickly. You may resonate with
                        these statements:<br>

                        You need to learn JavaScript to find a job in 3 months<br>
                        You read through tutorials but you can’t find answers to your questions.<br>
                        You can’t understand any of the tutorials you’ve read. They’re too hard or too advanced.<br>
                        You cannot seem to remember anything you learn about JavaScript.<br>
                        You compare yourself to other people (or to yourself). Then, feel proud or shitty about your
                        speed.<br>
                        The key here is to realize you may have (consciously or unconsciously) imposed an unreasonable
                        deadline for yourself.<br>

                        When you have an unreasonable deadline, you most likely hypothesize a solution/method with what
                        you already know. Your search for the answer then becomes googling to confirm your bias instead
                        of taking in information and letting your mind organize them (which is how humans learn).<br>

                        You may also have skipped steps, which is why you can’t understand the materials you’ve read,
                        or can’t remember what you’ve learned. This happens to many people who try to learn frameworks
                        like React without having a solid understanding of how JavaScript works.<br>

                        Overcoming the learn fast trap
                        The key to overcoming the learn fast trap is to prepare yourself to learn well, not fast.<br>

                        Take it slow. Pay attention and try to formulate arguments from what you read. While you do so,
                        drop any preconceived ideas you have about the subject. Best practices in one field may not be
                        the same in another.<br>

                        Dig into documentations, internalize fundamentals, figure out new best practices.<br>

                        Experiment. Code. Fail with your experiments. Start another. Do do it over and over, tweaking
                        till you succeed.<br>

                        When you work hard this way, the knowledge and skills you gain stays with you forever. You’ll
                        never forget them, even if you put them down for a year. JavaScript, like riding a bicycle, can
                        be a skill you keep for life.<br>

                        Plus, the more you know, the faster you can understand new concepts. That’s how our brains
                        work. Give yourself the time to let the initial concepts sink in. They may confuse you now, but
                        they won’t confuse you for long.</p>

                    The paralysis trap
                </h1>
                <p>
                    You’re in the paralysis trap if you feel you need to make the right decision before starting to
                    learn. You may resonate with the following statements:<br>

                    There’s too much information out there.<br>
                    You can’t decide what frameworks to use.<br>
                    You don’t dare to start learning because you don’t know what’s the best way to learn.<br>
                    You want to learn it the “right” way so you don’t have to relearn it later.<br>
                    When you don’t have enough information, you dig for more information. You feel you’re missing the
                    vital key before you can decide. Sometimes, you have too much information you don’t know how to
                    process them.<br>
                    Overcoming the paralysis trap<br>
                    They key to overcoming the paralysis trap is to understand that you can never be 100% sure that
                    your decision is right. You need to learn to make decisions despite not having the guarantee.<br>

                    Why?<br>

                    You don’t have all the time in the world to gather information. You can only work within your
                    constraints to gather as much as you require.<br>

                    Besides, you can never have complete information. Everyone has their opinions, so your information
                    is skewed anyway.<br>

                    But you still got to make that decision.<br>

                    Don’t worry if you’re wrong. It makes a valuable lesson. You know what not to do from now on.
                    Thomas Edison didn’t fail to invent the lightbulb for 9,999 times. He found 9,999 ways that
                    wouldn’t work. That’s why he made it the 10,000 time. <br>

                    Better to move and get it wrong than to stay still. If you move, you learn. If you stay still,
                    you’re stuck for who knows how long.<br>

                    Have you considered what costs you’re incurring by staying still. These costs are collectively
                    called the cost of inaction. It can cost you a ton.<br>

                    So take action. Take the wrong action if that’s the only thing you know now. You’ll learn to course
                    correct as you go. Once you get it right, you’re set.<br>
