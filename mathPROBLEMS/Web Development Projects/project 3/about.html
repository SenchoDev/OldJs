        <h2>
                Develop grid systems that scale naturally across different devices and resolutions.
        </h2>
        <p>I guess you could say I'm a creature of habit. Every time I start a new responsive web design project, I duplicate the same exact grid into my working documents: a 20px column structure with a 20px baseline grid. I lovingly refer to this as the 'picnic blanket', as it reminds me of the red and white chequerboard blanket my mother used to put out on the lawn.
                You might also recognise it as the pattern found on tablecloths in no-nonsense pizza joints. Instead of red I use cyan, but regardless, it serves the simple purpose of providing a foundation on which to build a well-organised design. In the last couple of years, Google has led the trend for the use of an 8px grid, with other brands including Spotify quickly jumping on board.</p>

        <h2>Consider all devices from the start</h2>
        <p>
                Often in our haste to get started we approach design with the idea that we will cover mobile later, or adapt to tablet from desktop. I know from experience that this simply does not work. If you don't plan for all content areas from day one, variations in content requirements between devices are likely to be neglected, as is user feedback.

        </p>
        <h2>
                Set your navigation first
        </h2>
        <p>'Workable area' is a bit of a misnomer because many designers assume it means the entire screen. In fact it does not. Side navigation, right rails and so on are allowed to fall outside the core grid area, and can be any width as long as they still allow for a uniformly sized content area.</p>

        <h2>Don't focus on screen size</h2>
        <p>Many designers get far too caught up in creating a grid that seamlessly fills 100 per cent of the content area they're targeting. This is a futile task, and means zero flexibility as layouts adapt to various screen sizes, both big and small.

                Instead, focus on creating the appropriately sized structure for the content you need to contain, and allow this safe area to sit within the canvas size. This approach has similarities with book design, where the page size isn't the focus, but rather the workable area within it.</p>

        <h2>Keep column widths consistent</h2>
        <p>This is paramount to my approach of creating a unified grid system that will scale across all devices with as little design adjustment as possible.
                Rather than changing the column widths across devices, the width should remain the same, and the number of columns should vary depending on the viewport. The moment a viewport becomes too small to display a full column, that column removes itself from the layout and the position of the content area adjusts to account for its absence.
        </p>
        <h2>Take advantage of negative space</h2>
        <p>Keeping column widths standard means that you can maintain constant content area dimensions as well. Consider this: a comfortable width for reading body copy on a desktop computer is 720px. Within a 1,440px-wide layout this leaves 360px gutter on the left and right. You can use these rails for related content or advertisements, or even leave them open to focus your reader's attention. When adjusting for tablet, simply drop 208px off each side, leaving your content area with 152px on the left and right, with no additional design work required.</p>
        <h2>Plan column width with mobile in mind</h2>
        <p>If you're using the 'consistent columns' approach, it's helpful to remember mobile screens are simply a quarter to a third of the width of the desktop view. Consider this early on in your process, as you create content blocks for your larger viewports. If you use content blocks that already conform to this width limitation, there will be less adjustment required when designing the mobile view.</p>
        <h2>Think of TV as tablet</h2>
        <p>The standard 12-column grid includes a baseline grid, main column structure, and subdivided 20px columns
                It's often exciting to think of TV as the largest medium available, but designing for a television screen is actually more akin to designing for tablet. This is because the elements need to be large enough to read from across the room. So despite having a large pixel density, TVs are better thought of as being 1,024px wide.</p>
        <h2>Stick to the grid, even when you break it</h2>
        <p>The term 'breaking the grid' should apply to the complexity of your visual system, not the positioning of elements in accordance with your initial 20px picnic blanket. When you turn the grid layer on you should see that every element has a home â€“ either resting on a grid line or positioned exactly halfway between two gridlines.</p>
        <h2>Constructing the grid</h2>
        <p>Everyone creates their grid layer differently. I prefer to set mine up as its own layer set in Photoshop, with one layer for the 'picnic blanket' and another for the columns. To create the picnic blanket I start with a 40px x 40px document and place a vertical 20px x 40px column on the left and a horizontal 40px x 20px row on the bottom.

                I colour them both in near pure cyan (#00bff3) and give them 20 per cent opacity. This colour choice stands out over most documents. This layer is then tiled into a pattern that I can apply to a layer in the master PSD, so I can easily adjust its height.</p>
